This Rails application allows partners to submit discount offers through a simple form with a title, email, expiration date, description, and image. All data is stored in a `discounts` table, validations are handled automatically (presence of title and email, expiration date at least 30 days in the future, image validation), and error or success messages appear directly thanks to Hotwire (Turbo Frames) without using custom JavaScript. Users can view the discounts via an API endpoint secured with HTTP Basic Authentication at `/api/partners/discounts`, which returns all discounts in JSON format with the fields `name`, `email`, `expiration_date`, `description`, and `image_url`. The application uses Ruby 3.4.8, Rails 8.1.2, the Lexy gem for the text editor, and Shrine for image management.
